# Features

## Responsive Layout

FlatPaper uses:

- three columns on home/list pages
- two columns on post pages
- a mobile drawer sidebar on narrow screens

On mobile, the top navigation is reduced to:

- sidebar menu
- site title
- search
- dark-mode toggle

The brandmark link groups move into the sidebar below the author card, and accent color swatches are shown directly at the top of the drawer next to the close button.

Horizontal overflow from fixed full-screen layers is clipped at the root level to avoid mobile horizontal scrollbars.

## Home Opening Hero

`home_hero` adds an optional first-screen introduction on the first home page.

It can show:

- site title or a custom hero title
- profile role, bio, avatar, social links, and RSS link
- a built-in scrapbook paper background
- one fixed image, or a random image from an array
- a configurable image overlay
- a bouncing arrow that scrolls into the home content
- draggable scrapbook stickers
- up to five custom image stickers, with optional visit confirmation links

The hero is disabled by default, so existing sites keep the normal home layout until `home_hero.enable` is set to `true`.

See [Configuration → Home Opening Hero](configuration.md#home-opening-hero) for the available options.

### Progressive Hero Image

`home_hero.progressive_load` enables medium-style progressive loading for the hero backdrop (ported from the anzhiyu theme's imgloaded.js):

```yaml
home_hero:
  enable: true
  progressive_load:
    enable: true
    small_src: https://imgapi.jinghuashang.cn/random?sort=pc  # small image (keep <100k)
    large_src: https://imgapi.jinghuashang.cn/random?sort=pc  # large image (final)
    mobile_small_src: https://imgapi.jinghuashang.cn/random?sort=sp
    mobile_large_src: https://imgapi.jinghuashang.cn/random?sort=sp
```

Behavior:

- The small image loads first and fills the hero under a 50px gaussian blur (hiding compression artifacts); the large image fades in once loaded
- Entrance uses `blur-to-clear` + `scale` (1.5 → 1) animations
- Scrolling drives opacity fade, zoom, and blur via `--process` (`scrollY / innerHeight`)
- Mobile (≤767px) automatically uses the `mobile_*` sources
- When enabled, the hero's own background image is skipped (the progressive layer takes over); `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the animation
- Implemented as `source/js/progressive-load.js`; config arrives via `data-*` attributes, no third-party dependencies

### Reveal on Scroll

Home modules (featured carousel, post cards, sidebar cards) fade up one by one as they enter the viewport:

- Elements carry the `reveal` class; `main.js` adds `is-revealed` via IntersectionObserver on first intersection
- Post cards stagger by index (60ms increments, capped at 300ms)
- Fires once; `prefers-reduced-motion` shows content immediately
- Custom pages can reuse it: just add the `reveal` class to any element

## Cover Images

Post card and featured images are resolved in this order:

1. `cover`
2. `thumbnail`
3. `image`
4. `banner`
5. first inline `<img>` in the rendered content

If no image exists, FlatPaper renders a CSS illustration fallback.

Images use `object-fit: cover` and `object-position: 50% 50%`.

When `post_top_img.mode` is `top_img` or `fallback`, the resolved top image appears at the top of article pages. The title overlays the image, and the image fades back into the paper below. `top_img` front-matter has priority, and `top_img: false` disables it for that post.

Standalone pages and special `type:` pages also support a page-local `top_img`. Page top images do not use `post_top_img` or any fallback fields; an image appears only when that page front matter sets `top_img`.

## Search

Search is opened by the header magnifier or `Ctrl+K` / `Cmd+K`.

The search index is built at generate time as a standalone `flatpaper-search.json` and fetched lazily the first time the panel opens — it is not inlined into pages. `search.limit` can cap the index to the latest N posts for large sites. Results highlight matched keywords with `<mark>`.

## Dark Mode and Accent Color

Dark mode is stored in `localStorage['flatpaper-mode']` and restored before paint to avoid flash.

Accent color is configured by `color` and can be changed by the user:

- desktop: header palette menu
- mobile: sidebar swatches

The chosen accent is stored in the `flatpaper-accent` cookie.

## Featured Carousel

`featured` pins up to four posts on the first home page.

Behavior:

- one post: static featured card
- two to four posts: carousel
- arrow buttons
- dot indicators
- keyboard left/right support
- autoplay with hover/focus pause

## Article Experience

Post pages include:

- sticky TOC
- cover-aware article header
- previous/next navigation
- related posts card
- comment jump button
- share button
- optional custom reaction buttons

The TOC sticks across the article range and avoids taking over home/list sidebars.

## Code Blocks

Code blocks include:

- language badge auto-detected from highlight classes
- copy button
- collapse button
- line highlight on single-clicking the gutter row
- line copy on double-clicking the gutter row
- `dark`, `sand`, `light`, and `simple` code themes

Plain text aliases (`plain`, `plaintext`, `text`, `txt`, `none`, `raw`) hide the language badge.

## Friends Page

`type: links` reads from `source/_data/links.yml`.

Cards support:

- groups
- avatar images
- first-letter fallback avatars
- descriptions
- optional RSS badges
- hover signal-pulse animation
- markdown body below the links data

## Reward List

Drop the structured HTML below into the body of an about page (or any standalone page) to get a scrapbook-style donation roll. Each donor becomes a paper slip with washi tape, a slight tilt, and an optional circular avatar in the top-right corner.

```html
<div class="reward-list">
  <div class="reward-list__item reward-list__item--p1">
    <img class="reward-list__avatar no-zoom" src="/images/donor.jpg" alt="Nickname" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
    <span class="reward-list__name">Nickname</span>
    <div class="reward-list__bottom">
      <span class="reward-list__amount">¥100</span>
      <time class="reward-list__date">2026-01-01</time>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p class="reward-list__total">Total <strong>1</strong> · Latest update: <time datetime="2026-01-01">2026-01-01</time></p>
```

Features:

- **Amount tier colors**: JS parses the amount text and colors the badge automatically — no style classes needed. ≥100 red, ≥50 green, ≥20 amber, ≥10 blue, ≥5 violet, ≥1 olive (RMB banknote colors). An explicit `reward-list__amount--100`-style class in the markup wins.
- **Rotating paper colors**: `--p1` through `--p5` (red/blue/green/orange/violet), with the tape color following the slip.
- **Avatar**: a `no-zoom` circular avatar is pasted in the top-right corner; omit the `img` and use `.reward-list__avatar--text` for a first-letter fallback.
- **Responsive**: multi-column auto layout on desktop, single column on narrow screens; supports dark mode and `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Sidebar Location Welcome Card

`welcome_location` renders a visitor-greeting card below the profile card in the right sidebar, based on the visitor's IP geolocation (kouseki style). Disabled by default.

```yaml
welcome_location:
  enable: true
  key: your-tencent-lbs-webserviceapi-key
  longitude: 105.43501   # blogger longitude
  latitude: 28.87875     # blogger latitude
  unit: km               # distance unit
  ipv6_text: 好复杂，咱看不懂~(ipv6)
```

Prerequisites:

1. Create an app in the [Tencent Location Service console](https://lbs.qq.com/dev/console/application/mine) and add a Key with `WebServiceAPI` enabled
2. Fill in `key` plus the blogger's longitude/latitude (pick from a map tool)

Behavior:

- Resolves the visitor's country / province / city from the IP and shows a tailored greeting (built-in table covering Chinese provinces and major countries)
- Computes the distance between visitor and blogger (spherical distance)
- Shows the visitor's IP; IPv6 addresses render as `ipv6_text`
- Switches a time-of-day greeting (morning / noon / afternoon / evening / night) by local time

Implementation notes:

- Vanilla JSONP against `apis.map.qq.com`, no jQuery dependency
- Card title uses the ID-badge icon (`id-card-lanyard`)
- Shows "定位失败" when geolocation fails; works inside the mobile sidebar drawer too

## Multi-language UI

FlatPaper's built-in interface text is localized and selected from the Hexo site `language` setting, supporting `zh-CN` and `en` with a `zh-CN` fallback.

- Template strings are resolved through a theme i18n helper backed by `languages/zh-CN.yml` and `languages/en.yml`.
- Runtime strings used by `source/js/main.js` (search states, code controls, anchor labels) are injected into the page as `window.FLATPAPER_I18N` rather than hardcoded in the script.
- Only theme UI strings are translated; post content and site data are untouched.

See [Configuration → Language](configuration.md#language) for selection rules.

## Integrations

FlatPaper includes optional wiring for:

- Twikoo
- Artalk
- Fancybox
- Umami
- Google Analytics 4
- Google AdSense
- RSS profile link
- custom HTML injection
